# README:

Module 1 Project for Creative Embedded Systems.



## <u>About</u>

This project involves running 2 programs on a raspberry pi on boot: 

1. The generation of a dynamic wallpaper on an external monitor using Processing. The wallpaper procedurally generates realistic trees in a watercolor style as well as mountains. The leaves continue to change color every few seconds.
2.  Python program connecting to the webAPI of timezonedb, displaying the time akin to a watch on a Freenove 8 RGB LED Module.   



## <u>Installation/Setup</u>

1. This program utilizes a raspberry Pi 3b+, along with a FreeNove 8RGB led module 

### Program Installations

1. Clone this github repo
2. Processing on Raspberry PI: To install Processing, go to the Raspberry Pi shell and do:

```
curl https://processing.org/download/install-arm.sh | sudo sh
```

3. Follow the instructions on to install the relevant libraries [Neopixel libraries](https://learn.adafruit.com/neopixels-on-raspberry-pi/overview )

### Hardware Setup



## <u>Running</u>

boot the pi and both programs should run.
